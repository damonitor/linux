TODOs
=====

Off the top of the head during LPC
----------------------------------

- Contig memory access util monitoring
- WSS/RSS based processes sorting
- LRU-based monitoring ops

By Priorities
-------------

- Write-only monitoring
  There is a patch doing the work already: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20220203131237.298090-1-pedrodemargomes@gmail.com/
  Need to wait until soft-dirty bugs are fixed, though.

- Export monitoring results in sysfs
  ('Efficient Monitoring Results Collection' of https://lore.kernel.org/damon/20220602002935.62334-1-sj@kernel.org/)

- Unify DAMON_RECLAIM and DAMON_PLRUS

- Multiple contexts per kdamond
  (to avoid interference between different contexts)

- Monitoring time quota
  Let users set time quota and automatically adjust
  {min,max}_nr_regions based on the time usage (per-context).

- Automatic paddr regions detection
  (handle hot(un)plugged memory regions)

- DAMOS denylist (or, more detailed target specification)
  Don't bother knowlegeable user space processes
  (adding target regions, type---anon,file-backed,numaxx,zonexx---, ...)

- DAMON-based Compaction Target Scanning

- Fixed granularity idleness monitoring
  - Must be useful for further DAMON overhead/accuracy evaluation

- Autotuning for DAMOS
  - Provide feedback sysfs file: Users could set values, or special keyword
    - keyword psi makes it works like TMO
  - Set watermarks based on min_freebytes

- DAMON-based THP hinting

- Improve regions-based monitoring quality

- Support cgroups

By Categorization
-----------------

DAMON Improvement
 - page-gran monitoring
 - accuracy improvement
 - more address spaces: read/write, numa, cgroups, files
 - intuitive overhead unit (CPU time quota instead of nr_{min,max}_regions)

DAMOS Improvement
 - more actions: THP, NUMA migration, ...
 - denylist
 - autotuning: feedback sysfs file accepting values and special keywords
   - writing big value makes the scheme more aggressive and vice versa
   - writing PSI_TMO makes it works like DAMON-based TMO
