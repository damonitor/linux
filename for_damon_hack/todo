TODOs
=====

- DAMON-based Proactive LRU Sorting (DAMON_PLRUS)
  - Patchset has sent and merged in -mm (https://lore.kernel.org/damon/20220613192301.8817-1-sj@kernel.org/)

- Write-only monitoring
  There is a patch doing the work already: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20220203131237.298090-1-pedrodemargomes@gmail.com/
  Need to wait until soft-dirty bugs are fixed, though.

- Export monitoring results in sysfs
  ('Efficient Monitoring Results Collection' of https://lore.kernel.org/damon/20220602002935.62334-1-sj@kernel.org/)

--- aims to do above before the v5.19 release ---

- Unify DAMON_RECLAIM and DAMON_PLRUS

- Multiple contexts per kdamond
  (to avoid interference between different contexts)

- Monitoring time quota
  Let users set time quota and automatically adjust
  {min,max}_nr_regions based on the time usage (per-context).

- Automatic paddr regions detection
  (handle hot(un)plugged memory regions)

- DAMOS denylist (or, more detailed target specification)
  Don't bother knowlegeable user space processes
  (adding target regions, type---anon,file-backed,numaxx,zonexx---, ...)

- DAMON-based Compaction Target Scanning

- Fixed granularity idleness monitoring
  - Must be useful for further DAMON overhead/accuracy evaluation

- Autopilot for DAMOS
  - Set watermarks based on min_freebytes
  - Adjust coldness threshold with PSI

- DAMON-based THP hinting

- Improve regions-based monitoring quality

- Support cgroups
