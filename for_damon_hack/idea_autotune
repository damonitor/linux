For increasing aggressiveness
-----------------------------

The scheme could be bottlenecked by the quota or access pattern (size/access
frequency/age).

If bottlenecked by the quota, increase size quota.
Would make sense to keep the CPU quota, though.

If not bottlenecked by the quota, adjust access pattern.
First, age.
Secondly, access frequency.
Adjusting size wouldn't make sense.


For decreasing aggressiveness
-----------------------------

Simply decreasing the quota would make sense here.


Discussion
----------

Given the prioritization, could adjusting access pattern make sense at all?
Maybe making access pattern just the hard limit, and letting the user to
specify minimum time to wait before start scheme operation would make more
sense?
