There are a number of researches[1,2,3,4,5,6] optimizing memory management
mechanisms based on the actual memory access patterns that shows impressive
results.  However, most of those has no deep consideration about the monitoring
of the accesses itself.  Some of those focused on the overhead of the
monitoring, but does not consider the accuracy scalability[6] or has additional
dependencies[7].  Indeed, one recent research[5] about the proactive
reclamation has also proposed[8] to the kernel community but the monitoring
overhead was considered a main problem.

Appendix B: Limitations of Other Access Monitoring Techniques
=============================================================

The memory access instrumentation techniques which are applied to
many tools such as Intel PIN is essential for correctness required cases such
as memory access bug detections or cache level optimizations.  However, those
usually incur exceptionally high overhead which is unacceptable.

Periodic access checks based on access counting features (e.g., PTE Accessed
bits or PG_Idle flags) can reduce the overhead.  It sacrifies some of the
quality but it's still ok to many of this domain.  However, the overhead
arbitrarily increase as the size of the target workload grows.  Miniature-like
static region based sampling can set the upperbound of the overhead, but it
will now decrease the quality of the output as the size of the workload grows.

DAMON is another solution that overcomes the limitations.  It is 1) accurate
enough for this domain, 2) light-weight so that it can be applied online, and
3) allow users to set the upper-bound of the overhead, regardless of the size
of target workloads.  It is implemented as a simple and small kernel module to
support various users in both of the user space and the kernel space.  Refer to
'Evaluations' section below for detailed performance of DAMON.

For the goals, DAMON utilizes its two core mechanisms, which allows lightweight
overhead and high quality of output, repectively.  To show how DAMON promises
those, refer to 'Mechanisms of DAMON' section below.


Appendix C: Prototype Evaluations
=================================

A prototype of DAMON has evaluated on an Intel Xeon E7-8837 machine using 20
benchmarks that picked from SPEC CPU 2006, NAS, Tensorflow Benchmark,
SPLASH-2X, and PARSEC 3 benchmark suite.  Nonethless, this section provides
only summary of the results.  For more detail, please refer to the slides used
for the introduction of DAMON at the Linux Plumbers Conference 2019[1] or the
MIDDLEWARE'19 industrial track paper[2].

Quality
-------

We first traced and visualized the data access pattern of each workload.  We
were able to confirm that the visualized results are reasonably accurate by
manually comparing those with the source code of the workloads.

To see the usefulness of the monitoring, we optimized 9 memory intensive
workloads among them for memory pressure situations using the DAMON outputs.
In detail, we identified frequently accessed memory regions in each workload
based on the DAMON results and protected them with ``mlock()`` system calls by
manually modifying the source code.  The optimized versions consistently show
speedup (2.55x in best case, 1.65x in average) under artificial memory
pressures.  We use cgroups for the pressure.


Overhead
--------

We also measured the overhead of DAMON.  The upperbound we set was kept as
expected.  Besides, it was much lower (0.6 percent of the bound in best case,
13.288 percent of the bound in average).  This reduction of the overhead is
mainly resulted from its core mechanism called adaptive regions adjustment.
Refer to 'Appendix D' for more detail about the mechanism.  We also compared
the overhead of DAMON with that of a straightforward periodic PTE Accessed bit
checking based monitoring.  DAMON's overhead was smaller than it by 94,242.42x
in best case, 3,159.61x in average.

The latest version of DAMON running with its default configuration consumes
only up to 1% of CPU time when applied to realistic workloads in PARSEC3 and
SPLASH-2X and makes no visible slowdown to the target processes.
